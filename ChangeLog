Thu Sep  3 17:27:35 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed RELNOTES.Eterm and split it into README and ChangeLog.  I also
	fixed options.c so that keysym definitions are at least accepted.  Now
	I'll have to find a tn3270 to test with. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 17:57:38 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>	

	Added the trans theme and fixed doc/Makefile.in to remove Esetroot on
	"make distclean"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 18:36:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the --shade option to replace the DARKEN_TRANSPARENCY #define.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 20:28:22 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed problems compiling with MENUBAR_MAX == 0 and without pixmap
	support and/or transparency support.

	Some unneeded code was removed from main.c as well.

	Added the --enable-menus (or --disable-menus) option to the configure
	script to automatically disable menubar support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 11:28:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added in the Eterm man page Shaleh <shaleh@debian.org> fixed up for us.
	Thanks Shaleh!

	Also updated the doc/FAQ.html file with the latest FAQ from the web.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 11:36:33 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Ripped the RELNOTES.Eterm stuff out of ChangeLog and put it in
	ReleaseNotes.  I decided not to use the name RELNOTES because it does
	annoying things with trying to Tab-complete "README". =)  From now on,
	ChangeLog will be the detail and RELNOTES will be the summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 13:24:49 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug mandrake pointed out where supplying a pixmap would kill
	a transparent Eterm.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 13:47:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the bug pointed out by technoir that made transparent Eterms
	flicker when there were two on the desktop at the same time and one was
	moving.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 15:42:55 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed scrollbar_floating with transparency so that the root image
	shows through underneath the scrollbar.  The effect is really sweet. :)
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 16:22:29 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed scrollbar_floating without transparency so that it shows the
	background color instead of white.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 18:48:08 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the --tint option.  Specify a shade of tinting for a pseudo-
	transparent Eterm.  It implies --shade.  Choices are red, green, blue,
	purple, orange, or yellow.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 19:31:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a stupid mistake in doing the tinting.  Also enabled "yes" and
	"no" as valid boolean values.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 21:34:09 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the color names.  Thanks to technoir for assistance with this.
	Choices are now red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 14:28:18 1998	sdh

	Apply focus color change to menubar and scrollbars.  Remove old
	code that was surrounded by CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS.  Toss
	update flag that was exported by scrollbar.h and let menubar.c &
	scrollbar.c track focus independently.  Old code was doing a bunch
	of XCreateGC's without ever freeing the gc.  Still a bit kludgy,
	but no more so than the shadow color code for the menu/scroll bar.

	New config option, unfocusedscrollbar <color>.  Command line
	option --unfocused-scrollbar-color <color>.  Add config entry to
	themes/Eterm/MAIN.

	Turn on CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS by default in feature.h.

	Add color init entry for menuTextColor def_colorName (main.c).

	Why does menubar.c use the global Attributes exported by main.c?
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 13:50:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Updated the menubar files to take advantage of some of the newer
	background images in the collection.  Also removed the pixmap menu from
	the "trans" theme since it's all ignored anyway.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 15:14:00 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Cleaned up the changes made by "sdh" (whoever that is). :-)  If the
	unfocused color is not defined, it will revert to the scrollbar color,
	creating a way to "turn the option off," so to speak.  It also makes
	sure that people who don't want to see the difference don't see it.

	Added autogen.sh for the tragically habitual. ;-)
	
	By the way, a few pointers for those messing with Eterm.  For one,
	feature.h is created from feature.h.in, so changing feature.h does
	not affect the final distributed form of Eterm.  I had to update
	src/feature.h.in to define CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS in order to see
	the changes take effect.  For two, if you change the MAIN.in for Eterm,
	please change the other themes too.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 17:16:34 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed transparency so that it works on any desktop, not just the root.
	Only works with E, so non-E users are S.O.L.  (Sorry, that's life.)
	Thanks to raster for helping me with this. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 20:52:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added a new feature.  This was requested by Nick Vargish
	<nav@patriot.net>.  Basically, the new option --watch-bg (or config
	file toggle "watch_bg") tells Eterm to keep track of the mod time of
	the background pixmap.  If the pixmap changes, Eterm updates and
	redraws the background.  When coupled with an outside program, this
	can produce cycling and/or animated backgrounds.

	NOTE:  This feature is highly experimental.  It can crash Eterm if not
	done properly and carefully.  In fact, at this point it's more of a
	demonstration/proof-of-concept than a feature.  If there is enough
	interest, I will internalize more of it.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 13:18:31 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the scrollbar_floating option with transparency (again).  sdh's
	changes on 9/5 screwed it up.  The pixmap now shows through once again.
	And there was much rejoicing.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 16:08:06 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added .cvsignore files.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 10:11:41 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug pointed out by Hans Engren <h@ns.engren.org> which kept
	Eterm and Esetroot from working under certain conditions.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 11:38:06 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Final documentation cleanups before the release of 0.8.6.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 12:04:43 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Final compilation cleanups before release of 0.8.6.  With this commit,
	CVS will contain the release version of 0.8.6.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 12:58:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Installed 0.8.7 into CVS.  This release has some major changes in it.
	For one, Eterm now uses automake and libtool.  The old libmej is now
	built as a shared library as well as a static one.  Also, everything
	but the main() function has been moved into a library, libEterm.  Since
	most people use lots of Eterms at once, creating a shared library will
	reduce the text segment of each Eterm significantly, saving quite a bit
	of memory per Eterm.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 13:10:20 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug compiling on Linux.  (Damn Linux having dprintf!) ;-P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 13:23:00 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed another bug on Linux, this time with linking Esetroot.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 14:10:05 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed MIN_ANCHOR_SIZE and added -a (--min-anchor-size) option.  It
	is 0 by default so ppl won't complain about the scroll-up "bug".
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 15:03:57 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed the pixmap setting code in Esetroot so it will (hopefully) work
	better.  Geez, if everyone would just use Enlightenment, it would save
	me so much grief.... ;-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 16:00:26 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the scaling problem in Esetroot pointed out by technoir thanks
	to some code swiped from Enlightenment.  I also nuked the code that
	was killing Enlightenment when running Esetroot.  (Not an E bug, just
	lame code.) =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 17:25:53 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Choosing a pixmap in a transparent Eterm now works.  I also renamed
	StrSep() to strsep() and changed configure.in to check for strsep().
	That allowed me to remove some really annoying #ifdef's in command.c.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 17:59:24 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added initial support for an escape code sequence set to mess with the
	various transparency options.  It doesn't work yet, so don't bother
	trying to use it.  Some of it will even crash Eterm at this point, but
	I'm going home anyway.  :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 11:42:16 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Initial work on a patch for CygWin32 support.  Also updated autogen.sh
	to create libtool stuff.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 15:25:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed some misc. problems with the new escape sequences.  Toggling
	transparency on and off now works (more or less).  At least stuff won't
	crash. :-)  Still some kinks to iron out, as always.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 17:21:52 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the escape sequence for Pixmap -> None (again).  Also made the
	transparency toggle work for not having a pixmap.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 18:20:47 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Updated the default themes to include the Trans menu.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 13:05:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Hack for newer Linux versions in which the real uid must be nonzero to
	open the display.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 13:50:50 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Moved the #define for the Linux fix into config.h
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 16:59:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This version has a working CygWin32 port! :-)  Some minor hacking may
	still be required.

	Also included a test for something with transparency.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:29:39 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed code to use setres*id() functions if they are there (Linux and
	HP-UX only AFAIK).  This is a vast security improvement for Linux.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:49:19 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Hopefully fixed privileges() for systems without setres*id() or saved
	uids.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:58:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More .cvsignore entries.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 19:03:22 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed the --watch-bg option to --watch-pixmap, which will hopefully
	make it less tempting for people to think it has something to do with
	transparency.

	Also added the --watch-desktop option which causes Eterm to monitor
	the desktop pixmap for changes and update accordingly.  It doesn't
	cause flicker like it used to.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 19:36:56 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some config file parser cleanups and additions to the trans theme.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:03:57 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Makefile and theme cleanups.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:45:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a major bug which caused Eterm to seg fault in trans theme.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:56:33 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed another seg fault bug, this time with changing the pixmap via
	escape sequence.  Doh!
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 21:03:34 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed the scrollbar_floating attribute back on for the trans theme.
	Geez, is there no end to the stuff I've screwed up today?? =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 09:33:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added some checks to autogen.sh
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 11:18:59 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Put in the #define IMLIB_TRANS, which will make Eterm use Imlib to do
	the transparency stuff.  There's a problem with it, though, either in
	Imlib_create_image_from_drawable() or the way I'm calling it.  For
	obvious reasons, it's off by default.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 16:39:15 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	As expected, raster's imlib fix corrected the problem.  Imlib
	transparency rendering now works as expected.  It is still off by
	default since tinting and shading aren't in yet.

	Also in this commit is a "fix" to autogen.sh.  I got complaints (well,
	actually one complaint) about autogen.sh not running configure, so now
	it does.  IMHO, this behavior is incorrect, as the function of autogen
	should be to GENerate the AUTOconf/AUTOmake stuff, not run it.  But
	since "all the other apps in cvs" run configure, for the sake of
	standardization and nothing more, I'll do it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 15:45:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the aforementioned memory leak as well as some others.  Dangling
	pointers were cut in half. :)

	Imlib transparency still needs to be worked on (read:  sped up).  One
	thing at a time though.

	I also fixed some duplicate rendering that was going on with
	pseudo-transparency.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 16:10:46 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the transparency toggle.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 17:05:31 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed bug in Imlib transparency code.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 19:46:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Looks like Imlib-based transparency is working now.  It only reads the
	desktop image once.  After that, it uses the same desktop pixmap
	throughout.  So startup is much slower, but through the rest of the
	run it's much faster.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 20:53:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added --shade-pct.  When Imlib-based transparency is enabled, you can
	specify a percentage by which to shade the background (0 being no
	shading, 100 being all black, not to mention rather pointless).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 10:41:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	With Imlib-based transparency, Eterm now takes --tint as a numerical
	option.  You specify a 24-bit RGB mask for colored tinting, such as
	"--tint 0xffafaf" for a deep red tint or "--tint 0xefefff" for a slight
	blue tint.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 14:48:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug in non-Imlib-based transparency.  I also made preparations
	for letting non-Imlib-based transparency do shading percentages and
	tinting masks.  Works on 8bpp, but since that's the only thing I can
	test, I'll wait until tomorrow and make sure the other pixel depths
	work before I go further.

	Imlib-based transparency is pretty slow, but there's more that can be
	done with it as far as RGB curves and stuff, so I plan to keep support
	for it in there.  But I'd stick to using Xlib-based transparency for
	now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 18:28:49 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the menubar code so that the menus aren't clipped by the window
	or screen edge.  There's still one small problem, but I'll look at that
	later. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 21:20:16 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	If root_pixmap() returns None, transparency gets turned off instead of
	rendering on a null pixmap.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 10:26:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed that one last menubar bug.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 11:46:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a segfault in Esetroot.  Also fixed --watch-desktop to work
	again (just for you, Nat). ;-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 19:07:11 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some bug fixes pertaining to root_pixmap() failing, transparency and
	background pixmaps coinciding, etc.

	Also changed the shell_expand() function in options.c so that \'
	within single quotes would insert a single quote.  This differs from
	the shell behavior, but I prefer it. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 24 17:14:29 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug with tiling pixmaps in transparency code.  (Didn't do it
	the way raster wanted it, but it works for now.  I'll make it better
	later.  Unless raster wants to patch it....) :-)

	Fixed a bug building without CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS support.

	Changed config file magic numbers to "Eterm-0.8".

	The latter two are thanks to Casey Zacek <casey@netcomi.com>
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 22:32:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug in Esetroot.c and the CUTCHARS default in src/feature.h.in
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 22:35:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Missed another typo in Esetroot.c
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 26 21:11:48 EDT 1998    mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	cleaned up a lot of stuff so it compiles a little cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 14:04:39 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed utmp.c for OpenBSD thanks to Jason Ish <jason@obskure.net>
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 17:14:11 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed the variables mandrake commented out, except for the one that
	was still needed.  I uncommented that one and put it in #ifdef's to
	fix the compiler warnings.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 15:24:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some transparency speed-ups (I hope).  Still trying to figure out why
	I'm not getting ReparentNotify events. =P  Also fixed the bug mandrake
	pointed out with transparency and the desktop dragbar under E.

	Also some fixes from Fritz Mueller <fritzm@digidesign.com> for X
	servers which lie about pixel depth and for a bug in Eterm's magic
	number checker.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 15:29:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Correct order:  Compile FIRST, commit SECOND.  Doh!! =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 12:06:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added --with-debugging[=num] to support debugging levels up through 5.

	Also added stack trace dump if the OS supports it.  In order of
	preference, the methods are:  U_STACK_TRACE() (on HP-UX in libcl),
	pstack (on Solaris), gdb, dbx.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 12:18:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Oops, forgot to add libmej/snprintf.c to the repository. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 11 17:35:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed autogen.sh so that VERSION was defined again.  Apparently
	running autoheader before other stuff in autogen.sh is a Bad Thing.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 17:38:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	If the desktop pixmap goes away (which happens if you're on another
	desktop for awhile), we'll just use the old one until it comes back.

	Also added Id strings to all C files.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 18:18:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added Id strings to the Makefile.am files, src/feature.h.in,
	configure.in, and autogen.sh.  Also added an entry to keep CVS quiet.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 12:55:13 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the bug with dragging a transparent Eterm across E's desktop
	dragbar.  It reparents to the root window for a bit, but once you drop
	the window, it changes backdrops right on cue.  Also works when moving
	Eterm windows between desktops.  Note that this requires the use of
	the -W (--watch-desktop) option.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 13:02:37 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Nuked some leftover code from testing.  (oops)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 14:49:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added some debugging code to Esetroot.c and added the -x switch to turn
	on debugging.  Hopefully this will help me track down the DISPLAY bug.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 14:54:46 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Blah.  Forgot to "if (debug)" out a couple lines. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 15:33:48 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed transparency stuff so it wouldn't take up mondo CPU time.  Since
	we're getting events for other windows now, we need to make sure we
	only act on events that are ours.

	Also fixed scrollbar coloring in transparent mode.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 17:03:47 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New features courtesy a patch from James Antill <james@crazylands.org>
	as described here:

	\e[9n prints the pixmap filename in the title bar.  In transparency
	mode, prints transparency info to the title bar.

	--home-on-input option which split off part of --home-on-echo

	Replaced "strncasecmp(buff, "string ", num)" with macro.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 11:11:04 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug with -W and -x together.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 12:26:53 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Final documentation cleanups for 0.8.7 release tomorrow.  Barring bug
	fixes in the next 24 hours or so, this is 0.8.7 as it will be released
	sometime tomorrow morning.

	* strings.c, strings.h: make everything consistent

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 22:26:47 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Major changes to the man page.  Hopefully people who actually bother
	to read the man page will find it easier to mess with the MAIN file.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 13:24:21 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Lots of changes here.  This is the first commit of 0.8.8.  The new
	features are:

	--shade now takes a percentage of shading.  0% is no shading, 100% is
	all black, and anything in between goes.  Percent sign optional.

	--tint now takes a 24-bit hexadecimal mask.  0xffffff is no tinting,
	0x000000 is black, and anything in between goes.  It will also take
	decimal or octal if you *really* have the urge, but hex is the most
	readable.

	-V (--menubar-move) now allows dragging the menubar to move the
	window.  It is on by default if the -x (--borderless) option is used,
	and off by default otherwise.

	The transparency/shading/tinting escape sequences now work.

	FORCE_BACKSPACE and FORCE_DELETE have been fixed.

	KS_DELETE (the strings associated with pressing the Delete key) is
	now set to ^? by default.

	-N (--anim) options for background pixmap cycling.  Syntax is
	"<delay> <background> <background> ..." where <delay> is the delay in
	seconds between updates and <background> is either "0 0 <file>" or
	"-1 -1 <file>" or "<file>".  This feature should still be considered
	beta.

	--with-cc argument to configure for forcing a build with an alternative
	compiler (for those who have pgcc but want to use gcc, etc.).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 16:11:37 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Feh.  Got rid of the warning in command.c.  Chalk that one up to
	laziness on my part. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 19:56:15 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added an optional boolean parameter to ESC ] 6 ; 0 escape sequence.
	Also added code to clear the shading/tinting when loading a new
	pixmap.  This will be an option soon, but not tonight.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 19:17:58 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support for the old color strings to the escape sequence handler
	for tinting.  They won't work on the command line, though.

	xerror_handler() will no longer exit Eterm.  We'll see how that goes.

	New --disable-stack-trace option to configure to disable stack
	tracing on abnormal termination.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  6 09:26:38 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Shading and tinting were broken for 2 days, and nobody told me.  Feh.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 15:38:11 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	No, I said *don't* exit on X errors.  And I meant it.  Really.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 20:00:08 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added src/Eterm.xpm as the default Eterm icon pixmap.

	Added the -I/--icon parameters to specify an alternate icon pixmap.
	The attribute "icon <filename>" is valid in the pixmaps context of the
	config file.
	
	Note that -I used to be --print-pipe.  Not any more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 11:47:42 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug when no background image was specified.  Dunno how on
	earth that happened....

	When Eterm gets the escape sequence to change the title, it will also
	change the icon name.  Not compliant with other terms, but I don't
	care.  What mandrake wants, mandrake gets. ;-)  Besides, sometimes you
	have to violate standards in favor of useability.  This is one of
	those times.

	When an icon is specified, use XGetIconSizes() to pick a size for it.
	When using the default, it's 64x64.  The WM can cope. :-)

	No, mandrake, it's still not ICCCM, but I'm working on it. :-)

	And no, raster, it doesn't snapshot the window.  I'll leave that one
	to you to write.  You can thank me later. >:)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 20:11:54 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Now the hosts in the chooser theme change the title bar instead of the
	menubar title, thanks to a new extended menubar function called
	"apptitle:".  See themes/chooser/chooser.menu for an example of it in
	action.

	Kterm (Kanji Eterm) now supports multi-byte fonts in the menubar,
	thanks to Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 12:18:00 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Wheee.  Minor bug fix.  Also redid the cvs_ident string declarations
	to make egcs happy. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 16:33:17 KST 1998    Sung-Hyun Nam  <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	KANJI: Minor memory leak fix.  Change XLOCALE stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 03:10:50 EST 1998	Gerald Britton <gbritton@mit.edu>

	Esetroot.c: Fixed an X server memory leak.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Nov 12 08:54:58 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Reverted Gerald's change.  Been there, done that.  It kills E.  Sorry,
	but if the X server doesn't work right, that's not my problem.  I'm
	not going to kill E over it.  Tough break.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Nov 16 19:31:29 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Finally got around to doing that icon window thing to make mandrake
	and ICCCM (the next-to-worst acronym in history, second only to i18n)
	happy.  Are we there yet?
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 17 11:17:57 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixes for Digital UNIX from <wd@unx.dec.com>.  These were all "Stupid
	KainX" bugs that I didn't catch because GNU's cpp is more forgiving
	than most vendors' cpp's.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 13:39:34 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This is the Correct (tm) fix to the memory leak pointed out by
	Gerald.  He and I had a pow-wow of sorts via e-mail with Nat and
	raster, and this is the solution that wasn't crapped on by anyone.
	:-)

	Just to document what we came up with....  Esetroot sets the
	_XROOTPMAP_ID property as always, but now it sets a companion property
	as well, ESETROOT_PMAP_ID.  Both are set to the same pixmap ID.  When
	Esetroot runs, it checks to see if _XROOTPMAP_ID == ESETROOT_PMAP_ID,
	and if so, it knows that it set the pixmap itself and can safely do
	an XKillClient() on it.  If they are not equal, calling XKillClient()
	would kill the application which did set it, most likely a window
	manager like Enlightenment or the patched versions of AfterStep or
	WindowMaker.

	No window manager code changes should be necessary.  If, however,
	a person were to write a "helper app" that sets the background (like
	Esetroot does), further memory leaks could be avoided by having that
	program set/change ESETROOT_PMAP_ID.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 16:26:22 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added -center (-c) option to Esetroot for centering the pixmap.  Most
	of these changes are from a patch submitted by Ralph Giles
	<ralphbla@sfu.ca>.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 20:05:05 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some fairly useless stuff that I really don't even want to document
	for fear it might actually get used, and people will expect more out
	of it than they should.  If you really wanna know, diff it. :)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 21:48:24 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New feature.  --pause will make Eterm wait for a keypress when the
	child process exits.  Useful most often in combination with -e.

	Also removed all traces of --watch-pixmap.  Good riddance.  -N
	(--anim) is much smoother and less bug-prone.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Nov 25 11:47:05 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some bug fixes in the ongoing saga of KainX vs. The Solaris 7 64-Bit
	Kernel.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec  4 16:11:03 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Ok, this should make Eterm compliant with the GNU FHS.  I also did a
	LOT of futzing around with configure.in, so if I broke something in
	doing either of these things, please let me know.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec  4 19:45:39 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Feh.  Thanks Pavlov. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Dec  7 18:04:09 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	FreeBSD fixes, fixes for building without Imlib support (oops), and
	fixes for the RPATH problem with Debian and autofs.  Thanks to Murray
	Stokely <murray@cdrom.com> for continued help on the FreeBSD front.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec  8 12:10:55 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Another of the Eterm-specific escape sequences.  This one is \e]6;3\a
	which will force Eterm to update the pseudo-transparent background.
	To those who've complained about -W making things too slow...Merry
	Christmas. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec  8 16:55:44 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Another oopsie from the December 4th changes.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec 18 13:44:04 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The long awaited selection options.  There are two new options here.
	The first, --xterm-select, duplicates xterm's treatment of cutchars
	(which is broken, IMHO, but some people want it).  The second,
	--select-line, causes Eterm to select the whole line on a triple-click.
	The default is now to select only to the end of the line plus the
	current word.  The corresponding config file attributes, xterm_select
	and select_line, both go in the toggles context.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Dec 28 18:20:01 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	From the Trying-to-Please-All-the-People-All-the-Time department...
	%random() seeds based on process ID *and* time(NULL) now.  Feh.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 16:52:34 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	A new Eterm feature.  This one is called "Viewport Mode."  It is
	toggled on by the --viewport-mode parameter or the viewport_mode
	attribute in the toggles section.  The basic concept is that the
	background of the Eterm window becomes a viewport to a background
	image.  Kinda like pseudo-transparency, but not related to the desktop
	in any way.  As you move the Eterm window, the background moves too.
	Scaled pixmaps are scaled up to the size of the desktop, and a portion
	shows through as the background.

	Okay, so it's kinda hard to describe. :-)  Just try it and see.  I
	recommend getting several of them open at once using the same scaled
	image.  The effect is interesting. :-)

	Shading and tinting don't yet work with it, but I'm getting there.  At
	least it won't crash your X server, like it did mine earlier. :-)

	Credit to es9 on IRC for the idea.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 17:12:57 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	And Tynian said, "Let there be Debian Stuff."  And there was Debian
	Stuff.  And it was good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 17:51:21 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Viewport + shading/tinting escape sequences is fixed.  I also fixed a
	bug with shading/tinting.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Dec 30 12:07:18 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added an Eterm.spec.in file as submitted by techn0ir, with a couple
	minor changes.  I know nothing about this file, so I have no clue how
	well it will work, if at all.

	configure.in now generates Eterm.spec from Eterm.spec.in to do
	automatic version updating.

	Minor changes to the Description section in the Debian stuff.

	AUTHOR'S NOTE:  None of the RPM/DEB information contained herein was
	authored by me.  I have no idea whether or not it will work; I rely on
	the package maintainers for that.  Though the authors recognize the
	utility and necessity of binary distributions for the various flavors
	of UNIX, we cannot in good conscious support any binary packages
	ourselves, for the simple reason that we don't know them all, and thus
	cannot support them all.  Out of fairness, if we can't support them
	all, we shouldn't support any of them.  Furthermore, binary
	distributions (especially when packaged by people other than the OS
	distributors) tend to be quirky, and we cannot support all these
	quirks ourselves.  So let me make it clear once again that any RPM's
	and DEB's of Eterm that may exist are supported ONLY by their
	respective maintainers, NOT by the authors of Eterm.  Any problems
	which arise with these packaged distributions should be directed to
	the package maintainer.

	With that said, we would also like to extend our thanks to the
	various package maintainers, with special mention of Brian Almeida
	<bma@debian.org> and Sean Perry <shaleh@debian.org>, for their
	continued support and assistance with packaged Eterm distributions.

	www.eterm.org is now alive and kicking.  All pointers to
	www.tcserv.com have been changed to point to the new URL.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 13:32:32 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Hopefully fixed a bug with backquote commands that don't return any
	output.

	Hopefully fixed a bug with shell_expand() being called with a NULL.
	In the process, I added some ASSERT() macros which may or may not be
	portable.  If they are, I will replace all assert() calls with them.
	If not, I'll nuke the one I put in. :)

	There seems to be a bug in main_loop() at command.c:4668 that has been
	uncovered by one person's mutt.  I added some debugging stuff to help
	track it down.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 14:31:06 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Stupid KainX error #13,471.8:  Don't use macros you don't have.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 16:30:54 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Work-around for what is either a bug or unexpected behavior in
	Enlightenment.  Other WM's leave coordinate setting for negative
	geometries up to the app.  Enlightenment seems to do it itself.  So if
	Eterm is running under Enlightenment, it will not do the offsetting
	itself.

	I'm curious to know if this is a bug in E or in everybody else. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jan  8 14:40:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Documentation updates for 0.8.8.  Wheeeeee. :)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 14:30:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Use Imlib_best_color_match() for all colors we allocate so that we
	coexist peacefully with Imlib, E, Netscape, et al.  This should make
	raster's day a little brighter.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 16:12:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed typos in MAIN.in files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 16:34:41 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Long-awaited transparency improvement for tiled desktops.  Let's hope
	it doesn't break anything.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jan 12 13:17:41 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Integrate random background functionality into Eterm distribution.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 10:49:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Add some more verbose output when color allocation fails.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 10:55:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Yes, Virginia, there is a 0.8.9.  Back to adding features.  Ugh. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 14:17:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More for 0.8.9....
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 15:15:52 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Mouse wheel support.  Does it work?  I dunno, since I don't have a
	wheeled mouse and can't test it, but it should.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 17:59:47 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New --version option to display compile-time #define's.  Also
	switched --help output to stdout instead of stderr (people were
	complaining about not being able to grep it...apparently
	"Eterm --help 2>&1 | grep foo" was too much work).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 28 11:58:26 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed typos in MAIN files.

	Also, there's code in command.c to attempt to set the desktop on which
	to open in Enlightenment.  It's commented out because it doesn't work
	and I'm not sure why. =}
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 28 12:29:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	An attempt at a fix, or at least to help find the bug.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb  2 15:10:43 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Tinting and shading speedups (about 30%) thanks to a patch from
	Michael Pearson <alcaron@ozemail.com.au>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb  2 23:27:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	You want scrollbars?  We've got scrollbars. :)

	New --scrollbar-type option.  Takes a string parameter, one of
	"xterm", "next", or "motif".  I'm sure we can all guess what it does.
	:-)

	More work on this tomorrow, but I need sleep.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 10:43:45 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug with tiled desktop pixmaps and shading/tinting.  Thanks to
	t'Sade <tsade@sil-usa.com> and Michael Pearson <alcaron@ozemail.com.au>
	for helping me track this down.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 12:26:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The resize-to-crash bug has *finally* been squashed once and for all,
	thanks to a patch from Sebastien van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr>.
	Thanks Sebastien!!
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 14:55:26 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	scrollbar_type now works in the attributes context of the MAIN file.

	New option --scrollbar-width (and scrollbar_width in the attributes
	context in the MAIN file).  Takes a positive integer and specifies
	scrollbar width (in pixels).

	Always update the background on startup.  This will help in cases of
	override_redirect (-x), no window manager, or a buggy window manager
	(reported with Window Maker 0.50.2).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb  8 12:16:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fix for a tiny hiccup.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 19:39:00 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Ctrl-Click behavior has changed.  Ctrl+Button1 now does the old raise-
	and-steal-focus thing.  Ctrl+Button2 toggles the scrollbar.  Ctrl+
	Button3 toggles the menubar.  These behaviors can all be turned off in
	src/feature.h but are on by default.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 22:32:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the --menubar boolean option to toggle whether or not the
	menubar is visible on startup.  There's also the "menubar" attribute
	in the toggles section, or you can put a boolean value after the
	filename for the "menu" attribute (e.g., "menu Eterm.menu off").  The
	visibility of the menubar can subsequently be toggled by the escape
	sequence or by Ctrl+Button3 on the term window.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 23:34:10 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support for popup scrollbars (i.e., the scrollbar goes away
	when Eterm loses focus, and comes back when Eterm regains focus).
	This is the --scrollbar-popup option or the "scrollbar_popup"
	attribute in the toggles context.  Idea courtesy Rahsheen Porter
	<rahsheen@neuplanet.cx>.  Thanks!

	Also, thanks to OctobrX <x@themes.org> for the menubar ideas above.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb 15 19:38:54 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New -D (--desktop) option (and "desktop" attribute in the "attributes"
	context) to choose what desktop to load on.  NOTE:  This requires a
	GNOME-compliant window manager which supports the _WIN_WORKSPACE
	property as defined by http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/.

	No, I will NOT use the Eterm*desktop Xrdb resource.  Read the FAQ for
	info on why I refuse to use Xrdb in any way, shape, or form.  I would
	rather wait for other WM's to reach the 21st century.  (Enlightenment,
	of course, is already compliant.)

	Also changed some short options for stuff that is never used, namely
	the -D, -U, -B, and -A options for the pixmapped scrollbar that we
	don't even have. =)  -D became --desktop, and -B became
	--scrollbar-type.

	Muchas gracias to raster <raster@redhat.com> for his assistance with
	the desktop thing.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb 15 20:00:59 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Work around a nasty Solaris X bug in _XFlushInt(), called by
	XUnmapWindow().  If we're not unmapped after 3 seconds, call _exit().
	If _exit() isn't around, use abort().
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb 16 11:21:59 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Implemented scrollbar type and width changing via an escape sequence,
	namely "\e]6;10;<type>;<width>\a".  <type> is either "xterm", "next",
	"motif", or blank.  <width> is a positive integer of reasonable value
	or blank.  Leaving both values blank does nothing.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb 17 18:54:44 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Two whole days' worth of work here.  I added bunches of escape
	sequences.  You can now set, configure, or toggle just about every
	part of Eterm via escape sequences, and have the changes live-updated.
	Look at src/command.c starting at line 6136 for the individual
	sequences.  There's oodles.  You can change scrollbar type, width,
	and location.  You can change screens.  You can change selection
	behavior.  You can even move Eterm to a new desktop.  All via escape
	sequences.

	Along with this, I redid all the *.menu files.  They are now much
	more organized.  They also have support for all (if not *all*, nearly
	so) the escape-code-configurable aspects of Eterm.

	Look for a GUI theme generator/configuration applet (gtk+-based) in
	the near (?) future that will take advantage of this. =)

	Also, no more trying to load the CVS directory as a background pixmap.

Thu Feb 18 10:26:56 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Patch from John Ellson <ellson@lucent.com>.  Render style was not
	getting properly reset for line wrapping.  His patched fixed extra
	underscores...I also fixed the other stuff, including rev. video.

	Patch from Ryan Murray <rmurray@cyberhqz.com> to add an rpath to
	Esetroot when linking.

	Thanks guys!

	Dammit.  I hate stupid bugs, and this is a big one.  Re-enable our
	own system() call, this time one that works.  If you setuid Eterm, you
	NEED this fix ASAP.  'Nuff said.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar  2 14:31:03 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Applied and corrected patch from Alexander Savelyev <fano@ham.kiev.ua>
	for supporting DESTDIR and for utmp on BSDI.

	Also fixed Esetroot for systems where root visual != highest visual.
	Thanks to Tomas Ogren <stric@ing.umu.se> for the patch.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar  2 17:27:22 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The -C (--console) switch works again, at least on Solaris and Linux.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 09:44:21 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Debian info updates from Brian M. Almeida <bma@debian.org>
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 17:58:55 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Reformatted code using new script, aptly-named "reformat-code," which
	calls indent.  Now if only there were a few more indent options, like
	one to keep the brace and the end of the function definition, and one
	to force a blank line *before* the declaration section.

	Also lots of utmp.c cleanups, including one that should fix the dying
	on glibc 2.1.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 18:04:49 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Oops, forgot some Debian files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 11 14:30:53 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed the default colors from names to rgb values (failsafe), and
	modified almost all of them to match colors Netscape uses.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 11 15:51:05 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Remove move-themes.in from distribution list.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sun Mar 14 12:32:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	By popular demand, the bright blue scrollbar/menubar scheme has been
	nixed in favor of a red/gray scheme that blends with the ShinyMetal
	Enlightenment theme.  I originally chose the blue to match the window
	border color in my StarTrek theme for E 0.10+.  I guess it was time
	for a change.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 16 09:21:53 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Checkpoint commit.  We're on our way to making debugging output a dual
	compile- and run-time option.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 16 17:34:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	. in config search path can cause nasty, hard-to-find weirdness.  So
	I nixed it.  I apologize in advance if you used it, but if you did,
	you probably have bigger problems.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 17 16:59:25 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Completely redid all the debugging stuff to facilitate the creation
	of a run-time option for it.  The option isn't there yet; that comes
	next.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 18 14:24:48 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Finally fixed a long-standing font alignment problem in the menubar
	when using nexus, shine, and similar fonts with 0 descent.  I then
	nixed the lame hackish work-around I put in awhile back so I could
	ignore it for a bit longer. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 18 18:05:30 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed another long-standing problem, this time with the placement and
	appearance of the menubar arrows, especially when --border-width is
	used.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 12:15:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New --debug option to vary the level of debugging output shown.  Valid
	values are integers 0 through DEBUG, where DEBUG is the value you set
	when calling ./configure with --with-debugging=N.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 17:34:52 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Implemented two new escape codes.  One is a simple "exit" feature than
	can be used from the menubar.  The other is a feature to save the
	current settings to a given file.  I added these two sequences to the
	menubar files.  The sequence for saving settings defaults to saving to
	the current theme, which is the behavior most users would expect.

	WARNING:  This saves *everything*, so if you have randomized
	backgrounds, tints, etc., DON'T use this!  They will go away!

	I haven't tested the save thing very thoroughly, so I'm not sure *all*
	the current settings save properly.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 18:20:28 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	After further consideration, added a routine to create a backup of the
	current MAIN file before overwriting it.  The backup is named with a
	timestamp, as in "MAIN.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS", so as not to conflict with
	any other backup files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 22 10:23:58 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Changed configure.in so that the default level of debugging support
	compiled in is 4 (the maximum level that does not sync X events).  The
	run-time default is still 0, however.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 18:16:40 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Whoops.  Inverted one set of arrows too many. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 18:50:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support in the options macros for specifying a variable to which
	the bitmask should be applied.  (The variable Options had always been
	used before.)  This will enable the manipulation of multiple bitmask
	variables via command-line options with no additional code needed.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 19:43:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added long-awaited options to set the keypad and cursor key modes on
	startup.

	--app-keypad (or the "app_keypad" boolean attribute in the keyboard
	context) will start in "application keypad" mode.  NOTE:  The new
	default is to start in normal (numeric) keypad mode.

	--app-cursor (or the "app_cursor" boolean attribute in the keyboard
	context) will start in "application cursor key" mode.  The default
	continues to be normal cursor key mode.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 21:28:57 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Nuked several bugs relating to printpipe.  Also enabled it by default.

	Removed the forceable addition of the '-g' flag to CFLAGS if
	debugging is enabled.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 17:54:03 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Lots of code cleanups here, plus a bugfix for menubars.  I might have
	done other stuff too, I forget.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 19:07:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added another little helper app.  This one is doc/Etbg, written by
	Brian McFee <keebler@themes.org> in a fit of boredom.  Thanks keeb!
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 22:08:45 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The rewrite of the Eterm Technical Reference.  It's HTML now, and is
	(at least to me) much more readable.  I've still got lots to add, but
	it's fleshed out enough to replace the old one now.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 11:25:24 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Oops.  Forgot to add the Kanji stuff to main.h.  Thanks to Sung-Hyun
	Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr> for catching this.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 19:37:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This is an attempt to fix X locale support, which was broken on Linux
	(XFree86?).  Please (!) let me know if I broke stuff, especially you
	who use KANJI.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 20:19:29 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Pre-emptive Kanji fix.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 30 13:07:05 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More robust font set for XIC.  Should be able to handle any charset.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 30 17:20:50 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Technical reference now includes complete documentation for all the
	Eterm-specific escape sequences.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 31 18:47:18 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support for the "ESC ] {l|I|L} string ESC \" sequences, a la
	dtterm.  'l' sets the title, 'I' sets the icon pixmap filename (or the
	default Eterm icon if "string" is missing), and 'L' sets the icon
	name.  Thanks to Mark Bowyer <Mark.Bowyer@uk.sun.com> for pointing
	these out.

	Look for more dtterm sequence support coming soon.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 31 19:56:07 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More work on the Technical Reference.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 10:25:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	At this point, the initial revision of the Eterm Technical Reference
	is complete.  I'm looking for comments, suggestions, errata, and so
	forth. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 10:37:57 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some rearranging.  Now doc/ just contains documentation.  The utility
	programs have been put in utils/.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 12:06:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New, improved color grid script, Etcolors.sh.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 12:40:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New, improved menu utility, Etmenu.sh.  Modified utils/Makefile.am to
	install these new utilities.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 17:48:47 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Doh!  Man page booboo.  Thanks to Jim Niemira <urmane@urmane.org> for
	pointing this out to me.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:18:09 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Support several dtterm escape sequences for window operations.
	Documentation is forthcoming.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:41:11 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added a rule to build an HTML-ized man page in doc/.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:55:41 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Gah!  I'd love to know who the idiot was who decided to put height
	before width.... >:P
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 15:15:42 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Documentation for new window ops sequences:

	ESC [ n [ ; n [ ... ] ] t
	
	n == 1: Un-iconify window 
	n == 2: Iconify window 
	n == 3: Move window. Must by followed by ;x;y 
	n == 4: Resize window. Must by followed by ;height;width 
	n == 5: Raise window 
	n == 6: Lower window 
	n == 7: Refresh window 
	n == 8: Resize text area. Must by followed by ;height;width, with
	        height and width given in characters. 
	n == 13: Report window position
	n == 14: Report window size in pixels
	n == 18: Report text area size in characters
	n == 20: Report icon name
	n == 21: Report window title
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr  6 13:33:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support for UNIX 98 pty's under glibc 2.1, thanks to a patch
	from Mikolaj Habryn <dichro-7815e9e@eris.rcpt.to>.

	Also added a new option to configure.  Use --without-sense-of-humor
	to disable the little libKenny joke (for the humorously-challenged).
	Credit to Paula Bailey <pmbail01@slug.louisville.edu> for the idea.
	And this :-P is me sticking my tongue out at the people who made it
	necessary! :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr  7 10:14:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed several bugs related to the %include directive and magic number
	version checking in the config file parser, thanks to a patch from
	Boris Badenov <sluskyb@lizards-lair.stwing.org>.

	Also fixed a couple oversights in Makefile.am in doc/ and utils/,
	pointed out by Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.

	Thanks guys!  :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 13:01:02 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Trying to get pty code in order.  There are some problems with glibc
	2.1 systems still.  I totally rearranged the pty-finding code, so I
	NEED lots of testing on this stuff.  Let me know if I broke/fixed
	anything.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 14:43:42 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Still trying to get that pty code in order.... :(
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 15:34:31 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	And again.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 16:21:21 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Now that the pty problems seem to be fixed (at least on Solaris and
	Linux), let's be a little more robust with failures.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 18:11:46 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed some assorted bugs and problems that occur when pixmaps.list is
	not present.  Also fixed a bug for output files that cannot be
	created.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr 15 16:01:03 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The borderless Eterm options will now make Eterm set the MWM hints
	so that the window manager will render it borderless.  (If the WM
	does not support the MWM hints, however, Eterm will fall back on the
	traditional override_redirect behavior.)  I've only tested this on
	Enlightenment, but it should work for other window managers too.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr 15 17:42:35 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the type of each variable to the help output, as well as some
	additional info on how to use the command-line options.  You're
	welcome, llane. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Apr 16 18:03:26 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added a -fit option to Esetroot which scales the image to fit the
	screen while maintaining its true proportion.  Thanks to Remo
	Strotkamp <remo@ccrl.nj.nec.com> for the idea and some code.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 19 13:55:09 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Two bugfix patches.  One is for compiling on SGI IRIX, thanks to
	Kimball Thurston <kimball@sgrail.com>.  The other was a fix for the
	recently-discovered segfault problem.  Thanks yet again to
	Sebastien van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr>. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 19 19:42:54 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Two more bugfixes.  Eterm now installs its X error handler earlier to
	catch more errors without dying.  Also, another patch from Sebastien
	van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr> for the segfault bug.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr 20 15:20:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	I think this fixes all remaining menu flickering problems.  I also
	removed a goto while I was at it, because goto's are evil.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr 20 16:05:50 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added a new option.  --select-trailing-spaces (or the attribute
	select_trailing_spaces in the toggles context of the config file)
	causes Eterm to keep spaces at the end of a line as part of the
	selection.  The new default behavior is to remove these trailing
	spaces.  If you select text in mutt (or other SLang programs), you
	will thank me.

	Also did some options-related cleanups in preparation for release.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 21 09:58:36 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This should take care of the man page for the release of 0.8.9.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 21 10:20:33 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added support, documentation, and .menu file entries for an escape
	code to toggle the select-trailing-spaces feature.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Apr 23 15:55:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Support the omission of the operator in an xterm escape sequence.
	Adding support for the dtterm stuff broke this.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 26 13:26:20 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Initial checkin of Eterm 0.8.10.  Please note the following WARNING
	which has been added to configure.in:

	This version of Eterm is highly experimental.  All kinds of things
	may be broken; in fact, it may not work at all!  DO NOT install
	this version of Eterm as your general-use version.  Even the
	developers aren't doing that!  You have been warned!

	If you run this version, you'll notice that the menubar and scrollbar
	have become pixmapped.  I've still got *lots* of stuff to clean up,
	but it's not looking too bad. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 26 16:59:37 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Cleanups of the scrollbar/menubar pixmapping stuff.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 26 18:51:34 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed some pointless compile-time #defines.  Added a separate
	menubar color and unfocused menubar color, along with options and
	attributes to support them (--menubar-color,
	--unfocused-menubar-color).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr 27 10:41:15 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added a pix/ directory for scrollbar/menubar pixmaps.  Swiped some
	pixmaps from Enlightenment to work with.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 28 16:43:47 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Scrollbar trough is now pixmappable.  Everything seems to work as far
	as I can tell.  Now on to the scrollbar anchor.

	I also cleaned up a lot of the pixmap handling code.  Tiling is
	handled the *right* way now. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 28 17:07:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixes from Karl Vogel <kvo@seagha.com> for Digital UNIX.  Now back to
	breaking stuff! >:-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 28 19:03:55 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Pixmappable up- and down-arrows.  The scrolling isn't working quite
	right just yet, though.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr 29 09:27:17 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Scrolling is fixed.  Now it's time to break all kinds of stuff....
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Apr 30 18:26:31 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	I've got everything cleaned up quite a bit now.  This one should
	compile and run just fine.  If it doesn't work for you, please let me
	know.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May  3 14:06:21 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Brand new event handling subsystem.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May  3 14:23:23 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a problem with transparency and a floating scrollbar.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May  3 15:00:37 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed problem resizing scrollbar with pixmapped arrows.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May  3 17:00:39 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Patch from Norman Stevens <norman@arcady.u-net.com> for builddir !=
	srcdir.  Also beginnings of pixmappable scrollbar anchor.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May  4 11:30:12 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The scrollbar is now fully-functional with every element pixmapped.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May  4 12:12:42 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	I cleaned up the code in options.c for reading pixmap configurations.
	You can now specify your scrollbar pixmaps in MAIN, like so:

	trough     100 100 bar_vertical_3.png
	up_arrow   100 100 button_arrow_up_1.png
	down_arrow 100 100 button_arrow_down_1.png
	anchor     100 100 bar_vertical_1.png

	These go in the pixmaps context, of course.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May  4 15:25:33 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Menubar background pixmap is now configurable.  In order to have some
	variety, I added two more auto-generated pixmap list files, one of the
	tiled images, and one of the scaled ones.  Here's the new line in my
	MAIN file:

	menu_background 0 0 %random(`cat tiled-pixmaps.list`)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May  4 17:46:20 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed some resizing issues.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May  4 18:55:34 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Temporary hack to keep background pixmap shading/tinting from
	affecting the scrollbar/menubar pixmaps.  I will fix this the Right
	Way when I redo the pixmap stuff.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May  6 11:23:48 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Back to breaking things....  I'm in the process of shifting Eterm's
	old "pixmap" paradigm to one based on 3-state images.  This will allow
	Eterm to support different pixmaps for the various elements based on
	state (normal, selected, clicked), as well as different shading
	levels, different tints, etc.  It will also support different image
	operations (tiling, scaling, proportional scaling, offsetting, and
	various combinations thereof).  But in order to do that, I have to
	completely redesign the pixmap code and alter parts of the config file
	format.

	This checkin is BROKEN.  It will not run.  But it will give you a bit
	of a glimpse at the future (if you look at the code, anyway). :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May  6 14:31:23 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Back in semi-working order (i.e., it runs without crashing).  Still
	details to iron out, of course.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May  6 18:08:02 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Almost back to where we were before.  A few small things still
	broken, but at least it runs without crashing. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May  6 21:55:26 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	All the pixmap manipulation code is working now.  There is a LOT more
	flexibility with this system.  Scaling and tiling are entirely
	independent, so for example, you can scale to 50% by 50% and tile, or
	scale to 100%, or scale to 90% while maintaining the image's aspect
	ratio, or tile the image at its true size....  There are all kinds of
	possibilities.  And the +X+Y offsets work again as well, so you can
	center images, or adjust the origin within the window however you
	like.  Plus, you can set the shading, tinting, geometry, and border
	widths of each image individually.

	The first screenshot at http://www.eterm.org/Screenshots.html shows
	two Eterms done this way.  The comment explains what I did to each.
	If you look at the Emacs window in the background, you can also get
	a glimpse of the new config file syntax.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May  7 13:34:38 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added image mode support.  For each image type, you can specify a
	startup mode and a list of allowable modes for that element (image,
	trans, or viewport).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May  7 14:22:27 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed bug with handling undefined contexts.  It won't crash on old
	themes now. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May  7 17:01:04 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Updated all the themes with the new format.  Read the comments for
	details on how they work.

	I also changed the default config file name since E doesn't use MAIN
	any longer.  The new name is "theme.cfg".  This will also create the
	possibility of a user-specific preferences file, "user.cfg".
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May 10 12:10:21 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the "path" statements in the default config files.  Also fixed
	the setting of the background image to "None."
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May 10 14:14:48 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Tinting and shading from the menu is fixed.  So are the image
	choices.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May 10 14:46:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Only track pointers if we're debugging.  Should help some on speed.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon May 10 16:15:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Shading and tinting via the command line work again.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May 11 14:00:36 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New --install option to use a separate color map.  This depends on my
	updates to Imlib 1.9.5.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue May 11 15:05:38 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed some assorted bugs with mode lines and with Eterm starting in
	the wrong directory.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed May 12 16:00:04 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed problems loading menubar files.  Also made theme searching more
	efficient.  Searching $PATH has also been eliminated since it took a
	lot of time for really no good reason.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed May 12 17:23:54 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Duh.  Fixed a stupid mistake on my part that broke background image
	tinting.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed May 12 19:17:59 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Per a suggestion from namsh, I cleaned up the #including of config.h
	since it does not keep itself from being included multiple times.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May 13 09:00:15 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed eterm_imlib.h since Imlib 0.x is no longer supported.  Also
	fixed the "status" escape sequence.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May 13 16:40:54 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed some bugs with transparency.  Also fixed a scrolling bug.

	The scrollbar event handler is now in place via the event subsystem I
	designed awhile back.  The scrollbar itself is now more self-
	contained, as it handles all its own events.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May 14 09:02:37 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More work on separating and encompassing the scrollbar.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May 14 14:51:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Command-line options for images are working again.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri May 14 15:44:31 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New escape sequence for setting the level of debugging output on the
	fly.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed May 19 12:45:49 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Moved some features to configure.in instead of feature.h.

	Also fixed my e-mail address to one that's more pertinent.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May 20 15:11:41 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Scrollbar images are now 3-state.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed May 26 12:11:51 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed the active tags stuff since it never worked right anyway.  We
	will do this eventually, but it will be integrated more into the
	system.

	Also added the skeleton files for the new popup menu system.  Bye bye
	evil menubar.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu May 27 11:52:37 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More work on the menu system.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun  1 13:34:33 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The menubar is now gone.  Totally and permanently.  Good riddance.

	Also in this commit is a fix from Luca Lizzeri <ll@niche.it> for
	multi-threaded builds, and I'm going to see how changing the default
	for HAVE_SAVED_UIDS goes.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Jun  2 15:02:29 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The menu can actually draw itself now, but not much else.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Jun  2 19:54:03 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Further menu drawing refinements.  Still not quite there yet, though.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun  3 09:34:05 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a segfault with themes lacking menus (which, at the moment,
	includes all of them but mine).  Thanks to Patrick Lenz
	<scoop@freshmeat.net> for pointing this out.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun  3 16:54:57 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Wow, it's actually starting to look semi-usable now. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun  3 18:03:36 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Both menu navigation styles are now working.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jun  4 16:51:26 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Everything works for a 1-tier menu, except for actually performing
	the action.  Next I'll implement that, and fix the bug with
	proportional fonts.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun  7 10:43:29 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eterm finally has a dedicated module for Enlightenment-specific
	feature support.  Don't worry, there's lots more to come here soon. :)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun  7 15:33:23 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Flat menus should be working now.  Now onto submenus....
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun  8 09:58:10 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixes for KANJI support.  Thanks to Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>
	for pointing this out.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun  8 14:24:11 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The submenu code is now in.  Navigation is still rather flaky,
	however.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Jun  9 15:24:15 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Navigation is still quite messy, but at least it's possible to get to
	all the menu items, and they actually seem to work.  So I'll commit
	this anyway.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 10 12:41:20 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Navigation is 99% clean now.  I've added the new menu files and such
	to CVS now, so you should be able to try everything out now.  Let me
	know if you have any problems.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 10 16:24:50 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eliminate one more stupid configure.in hack.  :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jun 11 11:11:31 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	A KANJI fix and a Makefile.am fix from Sung-Hyun Nam
	<namsh@lgic.co.kr>.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun 14 10:16:10 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Several oopses fixed.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun 14 19:21:11 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Initial work on supporting IPC (E IPC and Eterm's own IPC), as well
	as some bugfixes with the menu.  Also changed the default for refresh
	to fast (from smooth).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun 15 10:24:32 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Scrolling speed-ups, bugfix in menus.c for systems without save-
	unders, and corrections to menu config files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun 15 19:13:04 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the %preproc directive to allow Eterm config files to be pre-
	processed by the utility of your choice (so long as it can read from
	stdin and write to stdout).  Also modified the chooser-menu.cfg file
	to (1) work right, and (2) demonstrate the use of %preproc.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Jun 16 16:56:13 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some bugfixes with respect to escape sequence parsing, as well as
	improved formatting for debugging output.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 17 12:14:15 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added an Eterm IPC interface to Enlightenment's own IPC.  The escape
	sequence is "\e]7;enl_send:<command>\a".  Eterm can now be used in
	place of eesh.

	Also added a check to configure.in to make sure the OS's snprintf()
	implementation, if it exists, does not ignore the "n" parameter.  The
	macro for this was written by Duncan Simpson <dps@io.stargate.co.uk>.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jun 18 17:47:34 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added beveling and padding support.  I'll take care of updating the
	theme files later.

	NOTE:  You WILL have to update Imlib from CVS to successfully compile
	and run this version.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun 21 10:41:23 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug noticed by Gnea <gnea@grantstomb.com> with the menu code
	remembering the last selected item.  This caused certain toggles (like
	transparency) to misbehave when using click-select menu navigation.
	(Drag-and-release worked fine.)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun 21 15:39:26 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added the "winop" IPC command and a little helper script, so Eterm can
	assist in minor window manipulation needs.

	Also removed the old menu helper script since it's no longer valid.
	And I removed the .sh from the ends of the script names.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Jun 23 15:53:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Hopefully fixed the CONFIG_SEARCH_PATH definition under Linux.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 24 14:06:01 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eterm can receive Enlightenment IPC replies now.  Added Eterm IPC
	command "enl_query" which, unlike enl_send, will wait for a reply to
	its IPC command.

	Also added a skeleton function for when mandrake adds the image query
	IPC commands to E.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 24 15:02:38 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This should fix the bug Gnea found (see above).  My previous fix was
	incomplete.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jun 24 17:07:37 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added some checks to the config file parser which should help fix the
	issues between theme.cfg and user.cfg.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jun 25 11:52:41 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added keysym reporting mode from salvador <salvador@inti.gov.ar>.
	This feature is designed for application use and is not recommended
	for normal users to try. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jun 25 14:44:01 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	New utility Ettable.  Prints out an ASCII table in the current font.
	Useful for showing you what characters your font has as well as their
	numeric values in decimal/hex/octal.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jun 28 10:21:12 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the seg fault bug noticed by several people.  I guess Solaris is
	a bit more forgiving of free()ing memory you didn't malloc().
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun 29 11:48:56 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug with MWM hints thanks to a patch from MOROHOSHI Akihiko
	<moro@rd.nacsis.ac.jp>.

	Also fixed the menus to move themselves rather than displaying off
	screen when they are opened near the screen edge.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jun 29 16:38:25 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Updated the code formatting and added some to Ettable.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jul  5 23:18:49 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Moved to new CVS server.  Small cosmetic change as a test.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 15 17:06:07 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Don't copy the desktop pixmap unnecessarily.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 15 19:39:51 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	But don't free it if it isn't ours either. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 16 11:05:34 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Hopefully I found the cause of those weird hangs....
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 20 17:39:01 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Applied two patches from Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr> for much-
	improved multi-byte font support and internationalization.  Many
	thanks to him for his efforts, and my apologies for taking so long to
	get this patch in CVS.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 20 18:48:31 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed lots of code warnings.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 26 17:25:00 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eterm has a whole new concept of image color modifiers...basically,
	it's now the same as Enlightenment's.  Shading and tinting are
	gone completely as they were done before (along with the --shade and
	--tint options); they've been replaced by this new mechanism which
	gives you control over the contrast and gamma correction in addition
	to the brightness (the latter being the only thing shading/tinting
	messed with before).

	For the uninitiated...basically, each image has up to 4 color
	modifiers which can be applied to it -- one for each color (red,
	green, and blue) and one for the image as a whole.  Each modifier
	has three attributes which can be set:  brightness, contrast, and
	gamma correction (referred to as simply "gamma").  These modifiers
	are applied before rendering to alter the appearance of the image.
	This can be used to make images darker or lighter to improve text
	readability, or to make image details more visible.

	The old escape sequences \e]6;1 (shade) and \e]6;2 (tint) have been
	replaced with a single sequence (\e]6;1) which handles all color
	modifier changes.  The syntax is "\e]6;1;modifier;attribute;value\a".
	See the new menu config files for examples.

	Color modifiers for any image can be set in the config file.  The
	syntax there is "cmod modifier brightness contrast gamma" (e.g.,
	"cmod image 0xe0 0xff 0xff").  Trailing elements may be omitted,
	but leading ones may not (i.e., you may specify the brightness
	only without giving a contrast or a gamma, but you cannot specify
	the gamma without also giving the brightness and contrast).  If you
	prefer, you can use "colormod" instead of "cmod" for clarity.

	You also have the --cmod, --cmod-red, --cmod-green, and --cmod-blue
	command line options; these follow the same syntax as the config file.

	Hopefully that's clear enough. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 29 18:23:53 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Thanks to raster's advice, there is no longer a -W (--watch-desktop)
	option.  That behavior is now the default and exhibits no slowdown
	whatsoever.  I also cleaned up some silly repetitive bullshit that
	should speed things up as well.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  3 14:31:53 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a scrollbar bug raster pointed out and added the skeleton of
	action classes.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  3 14:48:48 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added 3-state support to the background.  Well, actually 2-state. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  3 11:34:56 PDT 1999	The Rasterman <raster@rasterman.com>

	fixed redraw of multi-state background :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  5 19:21:49 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Action bindings are now working.  See the new theme.cfg files for
	examples of how to use them.  I've duplicated the old bindings for
	Ctrl+Buttons and added the F1 key to bring up the Eterm menu.  I'll
	customize the themes to take full advantage of this feature soon.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 12:05:35 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a problem with actions with no valid button/keysym binding.
	Some of the action stuff is still having problems, but at least you
	can use the Eterms again. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 12:34:33 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Actions should be all fixed now.  Keep in mind, however, that some
	keybindings may not work the way you expect if you have your X
	mappings configured to send different keysyms when the keys are
	modified.  Check "xmodmap -pk" and "xmodmap -pm".

	Also applied a small XIM patch from Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 17 18:06:01 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Now that we have a fixed CVS server....  This includes the old 0.8.10
	code, but it's now 0.9.  It also includes a timer subsystem.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 18 14:58:08 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Cleanups on the automake/libtool stuff in src/.  Thanks to John
	Ellson <ellson@lucent.com> for getting me interested enough to set
	about fixing it. :-)

	Also cleaned up the XIM code to fit with the rest of Eterm.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 18 18:17:14 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Apparently, FreeBSD has a timer_t already, so I renamed Eterm's.
	Thanks to Carl Lewis <carl@dpiwe.tas.gov.au> for pointing this out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 19 16:45:36 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Applied patch from Valdis Kletnieks <valdis.kletnieks@vt.edu> which
	reduces the amount of excess space in menus when using proportional
	fonts.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 13:23:44 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Since Mr. Kletnieks reminded me that I never finished it, I finally
	implemented support for right-justified menu text. :-)  Now you'll
	know why some of those menus seemed unnecessarily wide.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 15:21:51 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Damn!  No wonder it's been so fscking slow.  Okay, folks, try
	some shaded transparency now.  I'll bet you'll notice a speed
	difference. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 16:05:59 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Ugh.  I'd fixed this on my local theme but never on the CVS stuff.
	Sorry, folks.  Thanks to Ashley Penney <ashp@bastard.co.uk> for
	pointing this out.  The F1 key should bring up the menu now, and that
	line should no longer generate a parse error. =)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 17:28:24 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a small bug in icon size handling located by Hubert Verstraete
	<hubertv@bigfoot.com>.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 10:33:20 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a bug where Eterm wouldn't start handling events soon enough.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 24 12:31:23 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added more debugging output to pixmap.c to try and locate some bugs.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 24 13:00:46 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed the bug reported by David Coulson <technoir@linux.com> that
	caused incorrect updates in trans mode.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 12:28:50 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Applied XIM fix from Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 19:39:26 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fix fix fix.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  3 17:05:02 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eterm passes "make distcheck" now.  Hurray.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  7 11:43:42 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added paranoia checks to make sure the desktop pixmap property hasn't
	been corrupted.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  7 13:15:30 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	make distcheck works without breaking regular makes now. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  8 11:11:00 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Patch from Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr> for the theme files.  Also
	added a timeout for the backtrace attempt so that it hopefully won't
	hang around forever when gdb decides to hang.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 13 12:23:36 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Removed the tn3270 theme, which nobody uses, and added the cEterm
	theme.  You get the same colors as Alfredo's original script, but
	without all the crap on the command line. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 16:41:08 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Worked around a XF86 3.9.16 (perhaps Xinerama) problem.  Also added
	some XIM changes from Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr> to handle
	buffer overflows.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 16:21:22 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed a possible null-byte overflow in the menu code.

	Also, there seems to be a memory leak in XLoadQueryFont() in some
	versions of XFree86 3.9.x, so I removed the unnecessary "font" lines
	from the themes for the time being.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 20 18:32:01 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Lots of changes here.  First off, this should fix the background draw
	bug with transparency that several people pointed out.  While I was
	at it, I also cleaned up a lot of other related stuff.  Three-state
	images should be a lot more robust now.

	Then again, some stuff may be broken entirely from this, so let me
	know. :-)

	For one thing, the various image modes should work as expected now.
	You can allow and disallow modes for the various widgets.  The
	fallback mode is "solid" now, rather than "image," so you can cause
	a certain widget to refuse to use an image if you want to.  If you
	specify an image without specifying a "mode" line that allows the
	"image" mode, your image will not appear. <-- READ THIS TWICE!  I
	had to go back and fix all the theme files because of this, so you
	will need to remove your current theme directory and allow Eterm's
	"make install" to put the new ones in place; otherwise, everything
	will go back to being solid colors. =]

	Anytime something changes this drastically, there are bound to be
	problems.  Let me know if you find any of them. :)

	Frikkin'...!  Well, this should fix the text updating problem with
	transparency, though I swear I don't know why it was crashing before
	and isn't now....

	Added support for xterm's property change escape sequence as requested
	by Greg Badros <gjb@cs.washington.edu>, the originator of the
	sequence (and one of the authors of scwm).

	Initial work on font caching.  WARNING:  This code is broken and will
	not compile, but I'm going home anyway.
