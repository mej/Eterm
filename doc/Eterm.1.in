.SH NAME
Eterm \(em
an Enlightened terminal emulator for the X Window System
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Eterm
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Eterm
\(em version
.B @VERSION@
\(em is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as an
.IR xterm (1)
replacement for users who want a term program integrated with
Enlightenment, or
simply want a little more "eye candy".
.B Eterm
uses Imlib for advanced graphic abilities.  See below for details.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B Eterm
options are listed below.
In keeping with the freedom-of-choice philosophy, options may be eliminated
or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults listed
may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system.

Options that do not take a parameter (besides -h and --help) are boolean.  If
you use the POSIX (short) option, you are forcing the parameter to "true".  If
you use the long option, you can use any of the accepted boolean values, which
are "yes", "on", "1", and "true" to turn the option on, or "no", "off", "0", or
"false" to turn the option off.  The same is true for boolean values in the
configuration file.

.BI \-\-bold-font " font"
Sets the bold text font to
.I font.
.TP
.BI \-F " font" ", \-\-font " font
Sets the normal text font to
.I font.
.TP

.TP
.BI ...
.TP
.BI \-\-font4 " font"
Sets font X to
.I font.
.TP
.BI \-P " pic" ", \-\-background-pixmap " pic
Use
.I pic
as the background image.
.I pic
can be in any format that Imlib understands.  Currently this means just
about anything, including JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PPM, etc.  The image is
tiled by default.  To scale the image, use the
.B --scale
option below.
.TP
.BI \-I " pic" ", \-\-icon " pic
Sets the icon pixmap file to
.IR "pic" "."
Works similarly to the
.B -P
option above.
.TP
.BI \-\-up-arrow-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's up-arrow is set.  
.B NOTE:
This is not currently implemented.
.TP
.BI \-\-down-arrow-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's down-arrow is set.
.B NOTE:
This is not currently implemented.
.TP
.BI \-\-trough-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's background (trough) is set.
.B NOTE:
This is not currently implemented.
.TP
.BI \-\-anchor-pixmap " pic"
As above, except the scrollbar's anchor image is set.
.B NOTE:
This is not currently implemented.
.TP
.BR "\-@" , " \-\-scale"
Scale the image rather than tile.  Only makes sense if the background pixmap
option is used (see above).
.TP
.BR "\-W" , " \-\-watch-desktop"
In a pseudo-transparent Eterm, this will watch the desktop for changes to the
image, Eterm moving to a different desktop, etc.  Use with the transparency
options below.
.TP
.BR "\-O" , " \-\-trans"
This gives a pseudo-transparent Eterm.  The image is taken directly from the
root window, so any requests for changing the pixmap are ignored.  If you do
not use Enlightenment (http://www.enlightenment.org/) as your window manager,
you will need to use the
.I Esetroot
program in the
.B doc/
directory to set your root background image.
.TP
.BI \-\-shade " percentage"
Darkens the background pixmap (either an image file or the transparent
portion can be shaded).  The amount of shading is controlled by the
specified
.IR percentage ,
which may or may not be followed by a percent sign.
.TP
.BI \-\-tint " mask"
Tints the background pixmap (either an image file or the transparent
portion can be shaded).  The
.I mask
is an integer, usually specified in hexadecimal in the form
.BR " " "0x" "RRGGBB" ","
where
.BR "RR" ", " "GG" ", and " "BB"
are hexadecimal numbers between
.BR "00" " and " "ff" " (" "0" " and"
.BR "255" " decimal)"
which represent the brightness of the image's red, green, and blue
values, respectively.  A value of
.B 00
will mask that color out entirely, while a value of
.B ff
will not change that color at all.  Some common tints are:
.RS 10
none      0xffffff
.br
red       0xff8080
.br
green     0x80ff80
.br
blue      0x8080ff
.br
cyan      0x80ffff
.br
magenta   0xff80ff
.br
yellow    0xffff80
.RE
.TP
.BI \-p " newpath" ", \-\-path " newpath
Sets the pic search path.  When the
.B --background-pixmap
or other pixmap options are used, this path will be used to find the image.
.TP
.BI \-N " list" ", \-\-anim " list
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the background pixmap.  The
.I list
consists of two or more words.  The first word defines the delay, in seconds,
between updates of the background.  This should be set to a reasonable value
to insure that Eterm doesn't spend all its time rendering backgrounds.  All
remaining words have the same syntax as the
.B background
attribute in a configuration file (two integers followed by the image filename),
except that the two integers are optional.  If they are specified, remember to
group them with the filename using quotes.  The following are both valid:
.RS 10
Eterm -N '10 image1.jpg image2.jpg'
.br
Eterm -N '10 "0 0 image1.jpg" "-1 -1 image2.jpg"'
.RE
.TP
.BR "\-l", " \-\-login-shell"
Makes the new shell a login shell.
.TP
.BR "\-s", " \-\-scrollbar"
Enables the scrollbar. (Default)
.TP
.BR \-\-menubar
Enables the menubar. (Default)
.TP
.BR "\-u", " \-\-utmp-logging"
Tries to enable proper utmp logging.  For this to work, Eterm probably needs
to run setuid or setgid, usually setuid root.
.TP
.BR "\-v", " \-\-visual-bell"
Enables the "visual bell".  Means the window will flash or blink rather
than beep.
.TP
.BR "\-H", " \-\-home-on-echo"
Jump to bottom on output.
.TP
.BR "\-\-home-on-input"
Jump to bottom on input.
.TP
.BR "\-E", " \-\-home-on-refresh"
Jump to bottom on refresh (^L)
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-right"
Display scrollbar on the right hand side.
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-floating"
Display the scrollbar without a trough.
.TP
.BR "\-\-scrollbar-popup"
Display the scrollbar only when the Eterm window is focused.
.TP
.BR "\-x", " \-\-borderless"
This option forces Eterm to have no borders.  This also means that the
window can not be moved (unless the
.BR \-V " or " \-\-menubar-move
option is specified) or resized.  Recommend using
.B --geometry
as well with this option.
.TP
.BR "\-m", " \-\-map-alert"
Un-iconify on beep.
.TP
.BR "\-8", " \-\-meta8"
Causes the Meta key to set the 8th bit in the char.
.TP
.BR "\-\-save-under"
If supported by the X server, tries to use backing store for faster
refreshes.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no-cursor"
Disables the text cursor.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-menubar-move
This options causes Eterm to enable the moving of the Eterm window by
dragging the right-hand side of the menubar.  This is useful for
borderless Eterms (and is, in fact, on by default if the
.BR \-x " or " \-\-borderless
option is specified).
.TP
.BR \-\-pause
After the child process terminates, Eterm will wait for a keypress
before exiting.
.TP
.BR \-\-xterm-select
Duplicate's xterm's treatment of cutchars.  The only real difference is
what happens when you double click on a single cutchar between two
words.  If this option is on, only that single character gets selected.
If it is off, that character is selected along with the two words.  The
latter behavior is useful for double-clicking on the space between someone's
first and last names, or the @ sign in an e-mail address, etc.
.TP
.BR \-\-select-line
If activated, this option causes a triple click to select the entire line
from beginning to end.  If off, a triple-click selects just from the current
word to the end of the line.
.TP
.BR \-\-viewport-mode
This activates a special Eterm mode which is hard to describe in words.
Basically, imagine the effect you get with pseudo-transparency, where
the desktop background moves through the Eterm window as you move the
window, so that it always aligns with the desktop image.  Now, imagine
the same effect, but the image used isn't the desktop image but any
pixmap you choose.  The image is scaled or tiled up to the size of the
desktop, and dragging the Eterm around the screen reveals different
portions of the image as you move, much like a small viewport window
in a ship or submarine does.  The effect is especially keen if you
open several Eterms in this mode with the same image.
.TP
.BI \-\-big-font-key " keysym"
Specify a keysym to increase the font size.  Default is Shift and the +
key on the keypad.  Ctrl-> or Meta-> may also work (if you #define one
of the hotkeys in src/feature.h).
.TP
.BI \-\-small-font-key " keysym"
Specify a keysym to decrease the font size.  Default is Shift and the -
key on the keypad.  Ctrl-< or Meta-< may also work (if you #define one
of the hotkeys in src/feature.h).
.TP
.BR \-\-app-keypad
Start Eterm in application keypad mode (as opposed to normal keypad mode).
.TP
.BR \-\-app-cursor
Start Eterm in application cursor key mode (as opposed to normal cursor
key mode).
.TP
.BI \-L " num" ", \-\-save-lines " num
Set the number of lines in the scrollback buffer to
.I num.
.TP
.BI \-a " size" ", \-\-min-anchor-size " size
Specifies the minimum size, in pixels high, of the scrollbar anchor.
.B NOTE:
This causes abnormal scrolling behavior when combined with large
scrollback buffers!
.TP
.BI \-w " width" ", \-\-border-width " width
Set the window's border width to
.I width.
The border this controls is the gap between the edge of the X window and
the edge of the terminal window; this has nothing to do with the window
border's your window manager supplies.
.TP
.BI \-\-print-pipe " pipe"
The pipe for the PrintScreen function.
.TP
.BI \-\-cut-chars " separators"
The seperators for double-click selection.
.TP
.BI \-M " file" ", \-\-menu " file
Replace default menubar file with
.IR file .
To disable the menubar altogether, do not specify a bogus value for
.IR file .
Instead, use the boolean option
.B \-\-menubar off
.TP
.BI \-\-term-name " TERM"
Use
.I TERM
for the value $TERM.
.TP
.BR "\-C", " \-\-console"
Grab console messages.  Depending on your system, Eterm may need to be
setuid root to do this.
.TP
.BI \-e " command" ", \-\-exec " command
Execute
.I command
rather than a shell.

.SH SPECIAL LANGUAGE FEATURES

.SH THEMES

Eterm is built on the philosophy of Freedom of Choice.  Each user should be
able to choose the environment in which he wishes to exist, and the tools he
uses should support that.  In accordance with that philosophy, Eterm is
extremely configurable.  Eterm supports a concept called "themes," which should
be familiar to users of Enlightenment, icewm, or Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT.
The general concept of a theme is a collection of resources that change as many
aspects of a programs look and feel as possible.  For example, an Enlightenment
theme allows you to customize menus, window borders, desktops, icons, iconbars,
and everything else about how E looks and feels.

An Eterm theme consists of a primary configuration file, always called "MAIN",
residing in a directory bearing the same name as the theme. This directory must
be a child of one of the directories specified by CONFIG_SEARCH_PATH in
src/feature.h, in the environment variable defined by PATHENV in src/feature.h,
or in the default PATH. The theme may also contain additional configuration
files referenced by the primary MAIN file, pixmaps, menu files, documentation,
etc., which are allowable as extensions to the minimum requirement of an Eterm
theme. 

By convention and default, Eterm themes should be stored under
~/.Eterm/themes/<theme_name>/ or @THEMEDIR@/<theme_name>.

All command line options can be enabled/disabled in the theme's configuration
file (the default is @THEMEDIR@/Eterm/MAIN).  The next section contains details
on the format and usage of the configuration file.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Since Eterm @VERSION@ is based on the concept of themes, it is vital that you
have a thorough understanding of the previous section before taking on this
one.  The previous section and this one were written by the same person who
wrote the Eterm code which handles options, config files, and themes, so it's
probably the most authoritative documentation on the subject you're going to
find.

From here on out, I will assume you've read the above text and know how to
change the default value for the theme and the config file name.  Just realize
that when I subsequently refer to MAIN, if you are using a different name,
substitute the name you supplied in place of MAIN.  I may also refer to the
Eterm theme.  If you are using a different theme, substitute your theme's name
in place of Eterm.  It is highly recommended that you have a copy of the Eterm
theme MAIN file that comes with Eterm handy while you read this documentation.

Okay, first the general idea.  The MAIN file is composed of comments and
non-comments.  Comments begin with a pound sign and continue to the end of the
line.  Lines of whitespace are also ignored.  The rest of the file is the config
stuff, which is divided into sections (called "contexts") and variables (called
"attributes").  There are eight valid contexts:  color, attributes, pixmaps,
toggles, keyboard, misc, kanji, and main.  Each attribute must be inside a
certain context to be valid.  For instance, while the "foreground" attribute is
perfectly acceptable in the color context, it would be rejected if found in,
say, the toggles context.  This allows for better organization of the config
file.

Each context must be enclosed in a begin...end pair that specifies the type of
section.  The statement "begin toggles" starts the toggles context, and the
next "end" statement would terminate it.

The rest of this section will contain a step-by-step analysis of the config
file, including what can go in each section.  Note that some attributes (and
even entire contexts) may not be available depending on what support was
compiled into Eterm by the person who built it.
.LP
.TP
MAGIC NUMBER

The first line of the config file must contain a "magic number" type line
that lets Eterm verify that it's reading an Eterm config file and not
something else (like an Enlightenment 0.13 and earlier config file).  The
line should look like this:

<Eterm-VERSION>

where VERSION is the Eterm version for which the config file is intended.
For example, config files written for Eterm 0.8 should have "<Eterm-0.8>"
as their first line, followed immediately by a newline.
.TP
MAIN CONTEXT

There are very few things that are valid within the "main" context.  In
fact, the only non-comment lines allowed in the main context are begin's
and end's for other contexts.  According to the internal mechanism of
Eterm, each context can have any number of subcontexts, but as it is
currently implemented, only main has any.  Valid subcontexts for main are
color, attributes, pixmaps, toggles, keyboard, misc, and kanji.  They can
appear in any order.  The order I list them here is simply the order in
which they appear in the default themes, which was arbitrarily chosen for
continuity.
.TP
COLOR CONTEXT

This context contains color specifications.  With the exception of
.B tint

.BI tint " mask"
.RS 5
Tints the background pixmap (either an image file or the transparent

.BR " " "0x" "RRGGBB" ","
where
.BR "RR" ", " "GG" ", and " "BB"
are hexadecimal numbers between
.BR "00" " and " "ff" " (" "0" " and"
.BR "255" " decimal)"
which represent the brightness of the image's red, green, and blue
values, respectively.  A value of
.B 00
will mask that color out entirely, while a value of
.B ff
will not change that color at all.  Some common tints are:
.RS 5

.RE

.BI anim " interval" "" " images ..."
.RS 5
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the background pixmap.
.I interval
defines the delay, in seconds, between updates of the background.  This

TOGGLES CONTEXT

This context contains boolean variables which can be toggled on or off.  Valid
values for the attributes in this section are "yes", "on", "1", and "true" to
turn the option on, or "no", "off", "0", or "false" to turn the option off.
These values are denoted by
.IR boolean .
They all default to false unless otherwise noted.

.RS 5
.BI map_alert " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will un-iconify itself when it receives a beep (ASCII 0x07).
.RE

.BI visual_bell " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will flash rather than sending a beep.
.RE

.BI login_shell " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will prepend '-' to the shell name when calling it.  Depending
on your shell, this may modify its startup behavior.
.RE

.BI scrollbar " boolean"
.RS 5
This turns on and off the display of the scrollbar.  Default is on.
.RE

.BI menubar " boolean"
.RS 5
This turns on and off the display of the menubar.  Default is on.
.RE

.BI utmp_logging " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will attempt to make an entry in the utmp file to record the
login information.  Eterm may need to run privileged to do this.
.RE

.BI meta8 " boolean"
.RS 5
Toggles the interpretation of the Meta key setting the 8th bit in a
character.
.RE

.BI iconic " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will launch as an icon.
.RE

.BI home_on_echo " boolean"
.RS 5
Zoom to the bottom of the scrollback buffer on output.
.RE

.BI home_on_input " boolean"
.RS 5
Zoom to the bottom of the scrollback buffer on input.
.RE

.BI home_on_refresh " boolean"
.RS 5
Zoom to the bottom of the scrollback buffer on refresh (Ctrl-L).
.RE

.BI scrollbar_floating " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, the scrollbar will have no trough.
.RE

.BI scrollbar_right " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will put the scrollbar on the right of the window (default is left).
.RE

.BI scrollbar_popup " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will hide the scrollbar when the Eterm window loses focus and restore
it when focus is regained.  Default is to not change the scrollbar state based on
focus.
.RE

.BI borderless " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will run with no window borders.  This also means that the
window can not be moved or resized.  You will want to specify a
.B geometry
with this attribute.
.RE

.BI save_under " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will use a backing store.
.RE

.BI trans " boolean"
.RS 5
Toggles Eterm's pseudo-transparency feature.  Yes, it's fake.  Yes, it will
always be fake.  Don't ask.
.RE

.BI watch_desktop " boolean"
.RS 5
This option is required if you want Eterm to watch for updates to the desktop
background image, including moving across desktops.  There is a speed sacrifice
that must be made for this feature, although I've tried to make it as small as
possible.
.RE

.BI no_cursor " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, Eterm will not display a text cursor.
.RE

.BI menubar_move " boolean"
.RS 5
This options causes Eterm to enable the moving of the Eterm window by
dragging the right-hand side of the menubar.  This is useful for
borderless Eterms (and is, in fact, on by default if the
.BR borderless
attribute is true).
.RE

.BI pause " boolean"
.RS 5
After the child process terminates, Eterm will wait for a keypress
before exiting.
.RE

.BI xterm_select " boolean"
.RS 5
Duplicate's xterm's treatment of cutchars.  The only real difference is
what happens when you double click on a single cutchar between two
words.  If this option is on, only that single character gets selected.
If it is off, that character is selected along with the two words.  The
latter behavior is useful for double-clicking on the space between someone's
first and last names, or the @ sign in an e-mail address, etc.
.RE

.BI select_line " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, this attribute causes a triple-click to select from the current
word to the end of the line.  If off, a triple click selects the entire
line from beginning to end.
.RE

.BI select_trailing_spaces " boolean"
.RS 5
If true, this attribute causes spaces at the end of a line to be included
as part of the selection text when selecting.  The default is to strip
these trailing spaces.
.RE

.BI viewport_mode " boolean"
.RS 5
This activates a special Eterm mode which is hard to describe in words.
Basically, imagine the effect you get with pseudo-transparency, where
the desktop background moves through the Eterm window as you move the
window, so that it always aligns with the desktop image.  Now, imagine
the same effect, but the image used isn't the desktop image but any
pixmap you choose.  The image is scaled or tiled up to the size of the
desktop, and dragging the Eterm around the screen reveals different
portions of the image as you move, much like a small viewport window
in a ship or submarine does.  The effect is especially keen if you
open several Eterms in this mode with the same image.

KEYBOARD CONTEXT

This context contains keyboard-related configuration options.

.RS 5
.BI smallfont_key " keysym"
.RS 5
Specify a keysym to decrease the font size.  Default is Shift and the - key on
the keypad.  Ctrl-< or Meta-< may also work (if you #define one of the hotkeys
in src/feature.h).
.RE

.BI bigfont_key " keysym"
.RS 5
Specify a keysym to increase the font size.  Default is Shift and the + key on
the keypad.  Ctrl-> or Meta-> may also work (if you #define one of the hotkeys
in src/feature.h).
.RE

.BI keysym " keysym" " " "string"
.RS 5
Define keysym
.I keysym
to send
.I string
instead of its default.
.I keysym
must be between 0xff00 and 0xffff or Eterm will complain.
.RE

.BI greek " boolean"
.BR " " "{ " "iso" " | " "ibm" " }"
.RS 5
Turn on/off greek keyboard support, and set which greek mode to use.
.RE

.BI app_keypad " boolean"
.RS 5

MISC CONTEXT

This context contains miscellaneous attributes that really didn't belong
anywhere else.

.RS 5
.BI print_pipe " command"
.RS 5

.IR command .
.RE

.BI save_lines " num"
.RS 5
Set the number of lines in the scrollback buffer to
.IR num .
.RE

.BI cut_chars " string"
.RS 5
Define the characters used as word delimiters to the characters contained in
.IR string .
.RE

.BI min_anchor_size " num"
.RS 5
Sets the minimum size, in pixels, of the scrollbar anchor (the part your mouse
grabs onto and moves around) to
.IR num .
.RE

.BI border_width " num"
.RS 5
Sets the width of the border between the text window and the X window to
.IR num .
.RE

.BI menu " file"
.RS 5
Loads menubar code from
.IR file .
The way to turn the menubar off is to not have this line in the config file,
but passing some bogus filename (or
.BR /dev/null )
as
.I file
will work too, though it may produce an error message.
.RE

.BI term_name " name"
.RS 5
Use
.I name
as the
.B $TERM
environment variable, which controls which termcap/terminfo entry gets used.
The default is
.BR xterm .
.RE

.BI exec " command"
.RS 5
Rather than executing a shell, this will cause Eterm to spawn
.I command
as its child process.  You can only have one of these!

KANJI CONTEXT

This context contains attributes which are only used when Eterm is compiled
with Kanji support.  This context is not valid in a normal Eterm.

.TP
BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

Eterm has a set of built-in functions which are available in config files.
They can be used anywhere their output would be valid.  Built-in functions
are prefixed with the
.B %
character.

.RS 5
.BI %random( params )
.RS 5
This function randomly chooses one of the words which compose
.I params
and returns that.  "Words" are defined in shell terms, meaning that single or
double quotes can be used to separate individual words of
.I params
which contain spaces.  And you can even get creative and use a
backquote-executed command to generate the list of words to pass to
.BR %random() .
The default themes that come with Eterm demonstrate this technique, in fact.
But keep in mind that random pixmaps aren't the only thing you can do with this
function.  You can randomize anything...colors, toggles, fonts, tinting...you
name it!
.RE

.BI %exec( command )
.RS 5
Executes
.I command
and returns the result.  Basically it's exactly like using backquotes, except
that it hasn't been implemented yet, so use backquotes instead. :-}
.RE

.BI %appname()
.RS 5
Returns the application name, a hyphen, and the version number.  Currently this
is the string 
.BR Eterm-@VERSION@ .
.RE

.BI %version()
.RS 5
Returns the version number.  Currently this
is the string 
.BR @VERSION@ .
.RE

INCLUDES

Eterm supports the
.BI %include " file"
directive to allow for separation of the configuration information into
separate files.
